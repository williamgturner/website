So disappointing because it was actually quite an interesting concept. Sandra Bullock has the choice between saving her relationship with her husband, or saving his life. The execution was very poor, and confusing. The doctor Eli Roth is introduced as a potential antagonist, or maybe simply a doctor trying to help; he then just disappears and you don't see him again, incredible.

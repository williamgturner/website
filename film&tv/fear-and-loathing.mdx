It's often hard for a film to live up to the source material, and I think the movie here unfortunately fell a bit flat.
I think what was missing was the constant tension that is throughout the novel. Each conundrum poses a risk to their adventure, and is exciting as a result.
Without a grounding in reality I think the movie lost something that the book had, the situations weren't exciting or seat grabbing as it was all extremely lighthearted.

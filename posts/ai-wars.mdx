Not too long ago, in a galaxy very, very near...

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet, and Google Gemini have the ability to revolutionise education. The last time a paradigm shift of this magnitude occurred was the advent of the search engine. Education is the key to unlocking new technologies that allow us to solve the issues that have plagued humanity since the dawn of time, like disease and hunger; and forge weapons that we will have to wield in the future battles against climate change, war, and resource depletion.

So why are people so goddamn upset about AI?

Critics of generative artificial intelligence raise many questions that are valid when taken at face value: what will happen to artists and authors? How will we be able to discern what's real online? What are the environmental ramifications of the server farms and data centres that power our future maths tutors and confidants?

I'll leave the philosophical quandaries for another day, though I do have my opinions on them. Instead I'll look at the environmental impacts.

One friend of mine recently told me they stopped using ChatGPT after learning how much water is used per query. The commonly cited study is the 2023 paper '[Making AI Less "Thirsty"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271)' which estimates water use at 500ml per 30 requests (16.7ml per request).

I'll admit this sounds scary. The devil, however, lies in the details.

*Note: Energy consumption can be used as a direct proxy for water usage. Water in data centres is used to cool the servers, which of course can only ever output as much energy in heat as they are provided in electricity.*

The original paper cites another [2020 study](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf) which estimates power consumption for GPT-3 at 0.4kWh per 100 pages of output. It then goes on to estimate an average conversation at ~800 words of input and ~300 words of output, deriving an energy cost of 0.004kWh. This is a gross overestimation of input lengths and, one source [here](https://www.semrush.com/blog/chatgpt-search-insights/) shows an average input length of 23 words, while others online are around 100.

Don't take it from me though, there are plenty of other people who have written about these same points like [Sean Goedecke](https://www.seangoedecke.com/water-impact-of-ai/), and [Andy Masley](https://andymasley.substack.com/p/whats-the-full-hidden-climate-cost). While hardly an impartial source, Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) claims a single request 'consumes' [1/15 of a teaspoon](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity).

[Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use) estimates GPT-4o's (A superior model to GPT-3) query energy usage at 0.3wh. Andy Masley above estimates 0.5wh per query for GPT-5, the latest and greatest AI model. To put this in persepctive, Andy compares it to:
- Running a microwave for 3 seconds
- Using a laptop for 1 minute
- Running a clothes dryer for 1 second

Sean Goedecke's estimates put water consumption at ~5ml per query, and Sam Altman's claim equates to ~0.4ml, a far cry from the original 16.67ml figure.

Even at the worst rates of energy usage, you have to stop and consider that fact that there are still large [efficiency gains](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ai-energy-efficiency/) being unlocked each year, not to mention how AI can allow us to advance efficiency in many industries through research and development. [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02623-1#Sec12) is a paper that examines the potential use for generative AI in ecology, and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/how-climate-tech-startups-use-generative-ai-to-address-the-climate-crisis/) is an article on four startups leveraging AI in fighting climate change (yes I know this is from Amazon, no this does not make it less true).

Furthermore, all energy consumption numbers are amortized, that is, they are estimates that include the cost of training the AI models, distributed over its "lifetime". While this doesn't make the costs any less real, the majority of the energy requirements go in to training the models initially. In other words, 16ml isn't evaporated from the water table of Ghana each time you ask ChatGPT to make your email less snarky. Once models are trained they exist forever! There are numerous open source models available to download right now that you can run locally on your own computer.

So instead of taking the high road on AI water usage, maybe put down the steak that consumed [50L of blue water](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731117002865) (ground and surface water) per kg. Better yet, next time you're at the supermarket, forgo the avocados that take anywhere from [150L](https://wrcwebsite.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/mdocs/2552%20Vol%2016.pdf) to [300L](https://greenly.earth/en-gb/blog/industries/what-is-the-avocados-environmental-impact) each to grow in water scarce areas of countries such as Chile; stressing water infrastructure via their intense irrigation needs.

Too often are LLMs either outright dismissed in their value, or turned into a punching bag to beat upon. It's trendy to "rage against the machine learning" so to speak. People are afraid of these companies, and maybe rightfully so, but don't take it out on the technology.

Believe me, I'm no fan of large corporations, which is why I, as a Firefox, DuckDuckGo, and Proton Mail user, can't stand being lectured about monopolistic practices, privacy concerns, and environmental impacts by these anti-AI luddites; the very same people who can't give up the convenience of Gmail and Google, while driving around eating their steak and avacados. We can all endeavour to live our lives more sustainably, but singling out AI usage is simply arbitrary and obstructionist.

I don't mean to be bitter, but it pains me to no end seeing how the discourse surrounding generative AI is so poorly informed and how rarely critics are coming from a place of good faith. There are genuine questions about intellectual property, privacy and ownership, but it requires everybody to come to the table. These misconceptions are so frustrating in the face of a revolutionary technology.

AI is here to stay whether you like it or not, and it should be exciting. A recent survey at my university found [77%](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/content/dam/uoc-main-site/documents/pdfs/d-other/air-survey-reports/UCount%202025%20Report%20-%20Students.pdf.coredownload.pdf) of students use generative AI in their studies. Democratising education by putting it in the pockets of people all over the world is a step forward for humanity. Let's put one foot in front of the other, rather than drag our feet into the future.

The following is an essay I submitted in 2023 for my first year course PHIL133 - Philosophy and Human Nature

Writing This Essay Was Alienating.

In this paper, I will explain why the process of writing said paper was alienating in the Marxist sense of the word. Karl Marx proposes his concept of alienated and unalienated labour in his 1844 writings *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.* Marx’s theory of alienation encompasses multiple types of alienation, such as a worker’s alienation from their product, from the act of production, from their species-essence, and from other workers. Marx uses these ideas in his critique of capitalism, stating that the system inherently alienates its workers and creates hostility. I will demonstrate how essay writing alienates the author from their work through commodification, and lack of ownership. I will also look at two arguments in favor of essay writing being unalienating.

## Essay writing as a form of self-realisation

Those who claim that essay writing is not an alienating labour may suggest that it is an opportunity for the development and showcase of one’s talents. They say that the way PHIL133 is structured presents essay writing in a way that provides an avenue for intellectual growth, open discussion, and critical thought. Essay writing can be seen as an opportunity for the author to present their unique perspective and express their individuality. This growth/development of one’s skills is key to what Marx calls ‘self-realisation’, an important quality of an unalienated mode of production. Developing one’s mind as is done through essay writing is antithetical to Marx’s (2007) description of alienating labour, the act of which “does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind.” (Pg. XXIII).

## Commodification of essay writing

I say that in an academic setting, the author (worker) is alienated from their essay (product) due to the commodification of their work. The university system mirrors that of a capitalist one, in which grades are valued over knowledge. Students are incentivized only to maximise their quantitative statistics; to increase their GPA. The ideas of the author therefore become commodities to be graded against a chart, exchanged for a percentage, and promptly cast aside. This creates a disconnect between the author and their essay. Where an essay is supposed to be a creative, personal reflection of the author, it now becomes distorted and reduced to an object of scrutiny. As such, essay writing cannot be said to be self-realising as it is not truly free. Because of the need to satisfy arbitrary parameters, essay writing does not develop the author’s skills in a meaningful way, it only improves the author’s ability to write essays. This changes the power dynamic between author and essay. Instead of the author exercising their will over the essay, the essay becomes an alien object, exercising power over the author. Proof of this can be found in the fact that essay writing is not a common hobby for the university student; enjoyment or value is not found in the labour. It is merely a means to an end. Marx (2007) summarises this with the sentence “Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague.” (Pg.XXIII). This alienation mirrors that of a worker under capitalism where the product of their labour is exchanged for wages. In our case, the essay of the student is exchanged for a grade.

## Species-essence

For one to counter this point, firstly, an important distinction needs to be made between unenjoyable labour and alienated labour. Kandiyali (2020, Pg. 7) specifies that while much drudgery (menial or dull labour) is alienated labour, some drudgery, such as cleaning brushes after painting, is not. This is because it is part of a larger, unalienated labour (painting). It therefore possible that while students may not enjoy writing essays, university, as a whole, is an unalienated labour that allows for the self-realisation of students. Following this logic, one may argue that simply because essay writing is not enjoyable, does not mean it is inherently alienating.

Some might argue that essay writing is not alienating, as it allows for humans to connect with their species-essence. Marx (2007) correctly states that humans are unique in their species-essence. For other animals, subsistence is their ‘life activity’, from which the animal itself is not distinguished. For man however, we are able to separate our need for subsistence from our being. What this means is that we are capable, and in fact in need of more sophisticated, creative labour. Wolff (2021) refers to the idea of alienating work as separating the worker from their human-nature of free, conscious, and creative work. It might be said that essay writing is the opposite of this, instead offering labour that is highly creative, and that requires deep conscious thought. This need for critical thinking is productive for the author and allows for them to connect with their human-nature.

## Loss of ownership

I say that the product of the author’s labour does not belong to the author himself, but rather to the evaluator. The student in an academic setting is positioned as subordinate to the professor or marker. This creates a power dynamic in which the student is trying to fulfil the needs of someone other than himself. When the student tries to meet the expectations of their superior, they lose control and ownership of their essay. Prescribing certain questions, marking sheets, adherence to established conventions, and formal language all contribute to a lack of freedom for the student. This disconnects the author from their creative and conscious nature. The needs of the superior in this academic sense are alien to the author and there is no direct relation between the needs of the author and the essay writing. Marx (2007) states that “If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, then this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker.” (Pg. XXV). The product of labour done in service to someone else cannot be defined as belonging to the worker. For example, the food prepared by a fast-food worker does not belong to the worker, the food belongs to the restaurateur. This lack of ownership between author and essay leads to alienation of the worker.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I have shown that despite claims that essay writing allows for self-realisation, in reality the only skill developed is that which is to write essays. I have shown how through the commodification and loss of ownership, essay writing is an alienating labour for students. Finally, I have shown that while on first appearance, essay writing seems as though it connects workers with their human nature, in reality, the restrictions put in place only further alienate the worker from their species essence.

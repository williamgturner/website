An interesting book. Not the unrequited love I was expecting.
<br/>
Frighteningly, Doc Holiday is the most moral character in this story.
<br/>
I watched the movie after reading, and I can see how it has been distorted. Regardless, I can't see Ms. Golightly as someone to admire (Which I feel I see a lot). 
Holly seems to be adept at wreaking havoc in her wake while adopting a care-free facade. The mask slips at the end and we can see the personal costs of her actions, which aren't pretty.

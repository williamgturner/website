A hilarious book detailing a semi-fictional-drug-fueled-gonzo-journalism expedition to Las Vegas.  
The writing is loose and the conversations can be confusing, giving you the slightest notion of what the characters might be experiencing.  


Thompson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas#The_%22wave_speech%22">wave speech</a>" has stood the test of time as an ode to the counterculture of the 1960s, characterised by forces such as the hippie movement and the sexual revolution.
The poignance of the passage can be observed in how it manages to invoke a longing and sense of nostalgia in me, for a time long before myself.

A hilarious book detailing a semi-fictional drug-fueled gonzo journalism expedition to Las Vegas.  
The writing is loose and the conversations can be confusing, giving you the slightest notion of what the characters might be experiencing.  


Thompson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas#The_%22wave_speech%22">wave speech</a>" has stood the test of time as an ode to the counterculture of the 1960s, characterised by forces such as the hippie movement and sexual revolution.
The poignance of the passage can be observed in that it invokes a longing and sense of nostalgia for a time long before myself.

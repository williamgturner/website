Steeped in symbolism and oozing with allegory. What I like about Ernest Hemingway is the low barrier to entry, and high ceiling of comprehension.
The vocabulary steps aside to allow light to shine on what's in-between the lines. Unfortunately I fear that some of the biblical allusions are lost on a gentile such as myself.

2021 was my final year of high school. The year, and probably more importantly, my digital technology teacher are quite important to me as I've gone on to study computer science, and as such they've essentially set me on the path in life I've taken.

Mr. Ny was a great teacher who taught us from the first year Victoria University computer science curriculum. We had the oppurtunity to learn Java, and the displeasure of using BlueJ.

The pinnacle of the year was our task to create a game of our choosing, I opted to recreate Minesweeper, much to my hubris.

Many nights were lost to reproduce the classic game, but I managed to develop something I was quite pleased with in the end.

My implementation was just about fully featured, the sprites were even drawn by yours truly in photoshop. The only thing that was missing was some hidden trickery to ensure your first click would reveal a 'pocket'.

At one point in time there was a version with a graphical timer, bomb count, and 'flagging mode' indicator. Unfortunately, this time in my life was before my introduction to Git or other version control, and as a result - these have been lost to time.

I have to give thanks to Victoria University's computer science / software engineering department for providing me with a copy of the ECS100 library to boot the app once more.

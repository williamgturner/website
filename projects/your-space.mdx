'Software Engineering 302 - Group Project II' is a full-year, compulsory course for software engineering students at the University of Canterbury. Not knowing quite what was involved, I, optionally, as a computer science student, enrolled myself.

Nothing could have prepared me for what would ensue over the course of the year. We were to work in an Agile environment in a group of 7. There was no lecturer, there were no tutors; in their place, we had a Product Owner, and Scrum Masters. Daily scrums took the place of our usual lectures, and retrospectives replaced our tests.

I was mortified the first few sprints. I thought I was out of my depth, and I felt as though my teammates were leaving me in the dust.

By the end of the course we would all become a tight-knit bunch of adpet programmers.

Our app, 'Your Space' is a tool designed for those people who just can't seem to stop moving their furniture around - I certainly know I have a few in the family. Users can create renovation records, fill them with 3D designs, and then submit them into weekly themed compeitions.

The app allows users to upload their own models and textures to place in their scene so they can recreate exactly what they have at home, or what they hope to have. Once in the scene, objects can be scaled, rotated, coloured, or textured, lights can can be brightened or dimmed, and made warmer or cooler.

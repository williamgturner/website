I've always been fascinated by what old-school developers were able to achieve with such limited hardware. Names like John Carmack, Chris Sawyer, and Dennis Ritchie are monoliths who belong on the hypothetical Mount Rushmore of computer history.

As an exercise in curiosity and sadomasichism, I created a pseudo-3D rendering engine from scratch.

The theory behind the engines that powered games like _Hovertank 3D_ and _Wolfenstein 3D_ is surprisingly simple - so after reading an overview of the mathematical steps required; and a quick touch up on high school trigonometry - I spun up a repo and got started.

The internal assessment for the course 'Software Engineering 365 - Web Computing Architectures' was twofold. The first part was creating the back-end for a game review site using Node.js, and the second part was to create the front-end in React.

Using <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a> and Tailwind.css, I designed my site as a tribute to Windows 98, aiming to recreate the desktop environment.

Being my first foray into React, and my first time making a full-stack applicaiton; it's a little rough around the edges. Some pages are lacking content, and others could've used a bit more love. Unfortunately due to the nature of University, I had to shift my attention once it was handed in and tend to other assignments.

I'm still happy with how it came out in the end. My personal favourite features are definitely the draggable windows, and pop-up input in the form of a new window.
